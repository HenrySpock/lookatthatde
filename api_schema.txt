I used Flickr as an external API for image selection. The app is based on creating lists of connected images, and Flickr has an easy to use api for searching images.

Schema:
 
        Class Name: Users (The class for the logged in user that relates to the user's images.)
        Fields:
            id 
            username 
            password_hash  
            email  
            is_admin  
            first_name  
            last_name  
        Relationships:
            lists_created: One-to-Many with ImageList
 
        Class Name: ListCategory (The parent class for groups of lists.)
        Fields:
            category_id  
            name  
            description  
        Relationships:
            image_lists: One-to-Many with ImageList
 
        Class Name: ImagePosition (A relation table that helps show images in order, modifiable by the user.)
        Fields:
            id  
            image_id  
            list_id  
            position  
        Relationships:
            list: Many-to-One with ImageList
 
        Class Name: ImageList (The parent class for groups of images.)
        Fields:
            list_id  
            name  
            description  
            creator_id  
            category_id  
            core_list  
        Relationships:
            images: One-to-Many with Image
            fields: One-to-Many with Field
 
        Class Name: Image (The class for storing the image_url, either from Flickr or user defined, that will be used in a list.)
        Fields:
            image_id  
            list_id  
            image_url  
            name  
        Relationships:
            field_data: One-to-Many with FieldData
            image_positions: One-to-Many with ImagePosition
 
        Class Name: UserImage (The relation table between users and their images.)
        Fields:
            user_image_id  
            user_id  
            image_id  
            name  
            description  
            is_custom_added  
 
        Class Name: Feedback (The table for storing feedback provided from users to the admin (ie, me.))
        Fields:
            id  
            user_id  
            user_email

            list_id  
            creator_id  
 
        Class Name: Field (Table for adding user-defined metadata to an image.)
        Fields:
            id  
            name  
            type  
            list_id  
 
        Class Name: FieldData (Relation table between image and field.)
        Fields:
            id  
            field_id  
            image_id  
            value
